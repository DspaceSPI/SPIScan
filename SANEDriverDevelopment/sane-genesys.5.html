<h2>NAME</h2><pre>       sane-genesys - SANE backend for GL646 and GL841 based USB flatbed scan-
       ners


</pre>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2><pre>       The <b>sane-genesys</b> library implements a SANE (Scanner  Access  Now  Easy)
       backend  that  provides  access  to  USB  flatbed scanners based on the
       Genesys GL646 and GL841 chips.  At present, the following scanners  are
       known to work with this backend:

              Medion MD5345/MD6228/MD6274
              Visioneer OneTouch 7100
              Hewlett-Packard HP2300C
              Visioneer Strobe XP100 (rev3)/XP200/XP300/Roadwarrior
              Canon LiDE 35/40/50/60
              Pentax DSmobile 600
              Syscan/Ambir DocketPORT 485/487/665/685
              Xerox Travel Scanner 100

       This  is  stable  software for supported models. But if you test new or
       untested scanners, keep your hand at the scanner's plug and unplug  it,
       if the head bumps at the end of the scan area.

       If  you  own a scanner other than the ones listed above that works with
       this backend, please let me know this by sending  the  scanner's  exact
       model   name   and   the   USB   vendor   and  device  ids  (e.g.  from
       <i>/proc/bus/usb/devices</i>, <i>sane-find-scanner</i> or syslog) to  the  sane-devel
       mailing  list.  Even  if  the scanner's name is only slightly different
       from the models mentioned above, please let me know.

       If you own a scanner that isn't detected by the genesys backend but has
       a GL646 or GL841 chipset, you can try to add it to the backend.

<h2>CALIBRATION</h2><pre>       To give correct image quality, sheet fed scanners need to be calibrated
       using the calibration sheet sold with the scanner. To  do  calibration,
       you must insert this target in the feeder then start calibration either
       by passing the --calibrate option to scanimage or by  clicking  on  the
       available  'calibrate'  button in the 'advanced options' in a graphical
       frontend. The result of the calibration is stored in a file in the home
       directory  of  the  user  doing it.  If you plug the scanner in another
       machine or use it with another account, calibration  will  have  to  be
       redone.


</pre>
<h2>EXTRAS SCAN OPTIONS</h2><pre>       <b>--lamp-off-time</b> <b>number</b>
               The  lamp will be turned off after the given time (in minutes).
       A value of 0 means that the lamp won't be turned off.

       <b>--threshold</b> <b>percent</b>       0..100%  (in  steps  of  1).  Select  minimum
       brightness  to  get  a  white point. Pixels whith brightness below that
       value will be scanned as black.

       <b>--disable-interpolation</b> <b>yes|no</b>
               When using high resolutions where the horizontal resolution  is
       smaller  than vertical resolution, data is expanded by software to pre-
       serve picture geometry. This can be disbled by this option to get  real
       scanned data.

       <b>--color-filter</b> <b>None|Red|Green|Blue</b>
               When  using gray or lineart this option selects the used color.
       Using a color filter will give a monochrome scan.  CIS  based  scanners
       can to true gray when no filter (None value) is selected.

<h2>SYSTEM ISSUES</h2><pre>       This  backend  needs libusb-0.1.6 or later installed, and hasn't tested
       in other configuration than a linux kernel 2.6.9 or higher. However, it
       should  work  any system with libusb where the SANE package can be com-
       piled. For setting permissions and  general  USB  information  look  at
       <b><a href="http://www.sane-project.org/man/sane-usb.5.html">sane-usb(5)</a></b>.


</pre>
<h2>CONFIGURATION</h2><pre>       The contents of the <i>genesys.conf</i> file is a list of usb lines containing
       vendor and product ids that correspond to USB scanners.  The  file  can
       also  contain option lines.  Empty lines and lines starting with a hash
       mark (#) are ignored.  The scanners are autodetected by  <b>usb</b>  <b>vendor_id</b>
       <b>product_id</b>  statements  which  are  already included into <i>genesys.conf</i>.
       "vendor_id" and "product_id" are hexadecimal numbers that identify  the
       scanner.


</pre>
<h2>FILES</h2><pre>       <i>/etc/sane.d/genesys.conf</i>
              The   backend   configuration  file  (see  also  description  of
              <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> below).

       <i>/usr/lib/sane/libsane-genesys.a</i>
              The static library implementing this backend.

       <i>/usr/lib/sane/libsane-genesys.so</i>
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems
              that support dynamic loading).


</pre>
<h2>ENVIRONMENT</h2><pre>       <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b>
              This environment variable specifies the list of directories that
              may contain the configuration file.  Under UNIX, the directories
              are  separated  by a colon (':'), under OS/2, they are separated
              by a semi-colon (';').  If this variable is not set, the config-
              uration  file is searched in two default directories: first, the
              current working directory (".") and then in /etc/sane.d.  If the
              value  of the environment variable ends with the directory sepa-
              rator character, then the default directories are searched after
              the  explicitly  specified  directories.   For  example, setting
              <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> to "/tmp/config:" would  result  in  directories
              "tmp/config",  ".",  and  "/etc/sane.d"  being searched (in this
              order).

       <b>SANE_DEBUG_GENESYS</b>
              If the library was compiled with  debug  support  enabled,  this
              environment  variable controls the debug level for this backend.
              Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output. If the
              debug  level  is  set  to 1 or higher, some debug options become
              available that are normally hidden. Handle them with care.  This
              will print messages related to core genesys functions.

       <b>SANE_DEBUG_GENESYS_GL646</b>
              This  environment variable controls the debug level for the spe-
              cific GL646 code part.

       <b>SANE_DEBUG_GENESYS_GL841</b>
              This environment variable controls the debug level for the  spe-
              cific GL841 code part.

              Example (full and highly verbose output for gl646):
              export SANE_DEBUG_GENESYS=255
              export SANE_DEBUG_GENESYS_GL646=255
