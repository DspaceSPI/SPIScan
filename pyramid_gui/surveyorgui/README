These files build the dspace shared library - it's intended to be used with
python - 'make' makes the shared library and pythion bindings, it builds the scan code from here,
Michael's arduino interface library, and will eventually include gps and stuff fr manipulating 
mpeg/etc


please note that only the dspace.py is used, compiling a new one should be done in /dspace-library
